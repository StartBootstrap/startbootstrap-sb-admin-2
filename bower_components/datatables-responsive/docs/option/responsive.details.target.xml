			As a string, this option is used as a jQuery selector to determine what element(s) will activate the show / hide control for the details child rows. This provides the ability to use any element in a table - for example you can use the whole row, or a single `-tag img` element in the row.

		When the `column` type is selected for the `r-init responsive.details.type` option, this option provides the ability to control what element in the table will activate the show / hide control in each row. This can be one of an column index, or a jQuery selector, as detailed below.

		If the `inline` option is used for `r-init responsive.details.type` this option has no effect.

		Please note that as with all other configuration options for Responsive, this option is an extension to the [default set of DataTables options](/reference/init). This property should be set in the DataTables initialisation object.
