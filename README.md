<h4 class="p1">Chicken </h4>
    <p class="pa">
        A chicken is a bird. One of the features that differentiate it from most other birds is that it has a comb and two wattles.
        The comb is the red appendage on the top of the head, and the wattles are the two appendages under the chin. These are secondary sexual
        characteristics and are more prominent in the male. A few other birds have a comb or similar appendage,
        in some cases bearing a different name such as helmet in the guinea, and a few have wattles with some having a single median one rather than a pair.
        The comb is the basis of the Latin name or classification of chickens.
        In Latin, gallus means comb, and the domestic chicken is Gallus domesticus. The Red Jungle Fowl, ancestor of most domestic chickens, is Gallus bankiva.
        There are eight recognized kinds of combs: single, rose, pea, cushion, buttercup, strawberry, V-shaped, and silkie.
        The chicken has two legs and two wings, a fact that influences housing and management. Domestic chickens have essentially
        lost the ability to fly. Heavy breeds used for meat production cannot do more than flap their wings and jump to a little higher level or move more rapidly along the ground.
        The lighter-bodied birds can fly short distances, and some can fly over relatively high fences.
        The feet and shank portions of the legs have scales.
        Chickens are covered with feathers but have a few vestigial hairs scattered over the body. The average consumer does not see these hairs,
        because they are singed off in the processing plant. The chicken has a beak (or bill) and does not have teeth. Any mastication occurs in the gizzard.
        Many commercial poultry producers do not provide grit to their chickens, because they feed a ground feed of fine meal consistency that can be digested by the bird's digestive juices.
        Chickens have comparatively short life spans. Some live to be 10 to 15 years old, but they are the exception, not the rule.
        In commercial egg production, birds are about 18 months old when they are replaced by new, young stock.
        Chicken can be cooked in many ways. It can be made into sausages, skewered, put in salads, traditionally grilled or by using electric grill,
        breaded and deep-fried, or used in various curries. There is significant variation in cooking methods amongst cultures.

        <h4 class="p1">Beef </h4>
        <p class="pa">
            Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times. Beef is a source of high-quality protein and nutrients.
            Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts,
            such as roasts, short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.),
            while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings, on the other hand, are usually mixed with meat from older,
            leaner (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is used in some varieties called blood sausage.
            Other parts that are eaten include other muscles and offal, such as the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands
            (particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the brain (although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine
            spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, commonly referred to as mad cow disease), the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull (known in the United States as calf fries, prairie oysters,
            or Rocky Mountain oysters). Some intestines are cooked and eaten as is,[3] but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings.
            The bones are used for making beef stock. Meat from younger cows (calves) is called veal.
            Meat has usually been cooked in water which is just simmering, such as in stewing; higher temperatures make meat tougher by causing the proteins
            to contract. Since thermostatic temperature control became available, cooking at temperatures well below boiling, 52 °C (126 °F) (sous-vide) to
            90 °C (194 °F) (slow cooking), for prolonged periods has become possible;
            this is just hot enough to convert the tough collagen in connective tissue into gelatin through hydrolysis, with minimal toughening.
            Meat can be cooked in boiling oil, typically by shallow frying, although deep frying may be used, often for meat enrobed with breadcrumbs
            as in milanesas or finger steaks. Larger pieces such as steaks may be cooked this way, or meat may be cut smaller as in stir frying, typically an Asian way of cooking:
            cooking oil with flavorings such as garlic, ginger and onions is put in a very hot wok.

        <h4 class="p1">Sushi </h4>
        <p class="pa">
            Sushi originates in a Southeast Asian dish, known as narezushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司 – "salted fish"), stored in fermented rice for possibly
            months at a time. The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevented the fish from spoiling;[3] the rice would be discarded before
            consumption of the fish. This early type of sushi became an important source of protein for its Japanese consumers.
            The term sushi literally means "sour-tasting" and comes from an antiquated し (shi) terminal-form conjugation, 酸し sushi,
            no longer used in other contexts, of the adjectival verb 酸い sui "to be sour";the overall dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste.
             Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty, notably as funa-zushi from Shiga Prefecture.
            Osaka-style sushi, also called "Oshi-zushi" or "hako-sushi"
            Vinegar began to be added to the preparation of narezushi in the Muromachi period (1336–1573)
            for the sake of enhancing both taste and preservation. In addition to increasing the sourness of the rice,
            the vinegar significantly increased the dish's longevity, causing the fermentation process to be shortened and eventually abandoned.
            The primitive sushi would be further developed in Osaka, where over several centuries it became oshi-zushi or "hako-zushi"; in this preparation, the seafood and rice were
            pressed into shape with wooden (typically bamboo) molds.
            It was not until the Edo period (1603–1868) that fresh fish was served over vinegared rice and nori.
            The particular style of today's nigirizushi became popular in Edo (contemporary Tokyo) in the 1820s or 1830s.
            One common story of nigirizushi's origins is of the chef Hanaya Yohei (1799–1858), who invented or perfected the technique in 1824 at his
            shop in Ryōgoku. The dish was originally termed Edomae zushi as it used freshly caught fish from the Edo-mae (Edo or Tokyo Bay);
            the term Edomae nigirizushi is still used today as a by-word for quality sushi, regardless of its ingredients' origins.
